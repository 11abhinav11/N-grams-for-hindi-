# Hindi Sentence Autocompletion using N-gram Language Model

## Overview
This project implements a Hindi sentence autocompletion system using an N-gram language model. The system suggests the next word or words in a sentence based on the input provided by the user. 
N-gram language models are statistical models that predict the probability of a word given the previous (N-1) words in a sequence.

## Features
* Autocompletion of Hindi sentences based on N-gram language model
* Adjustable N-gram order to balance between accuracy and computational complexity
* Support for handling out-of-vocabulary words and unseen word sequences
* Simple and intuitive user interface for interaction

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Hindi text corpus for training the N-gram language model
* Additional Python libraries: nltk (Natural Language Toolkit), pandas, numpy

## Installation
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub link.
Install the required Python libraries using pip:
Copy code
```python
pip install nltk pandas numpy
```
Download the Hindi text corpus for training the language model. You can use any publicly available corpus or create your own.

## Usage
* Train the N-gram language model using the provided Hindi text corpus. You can adjust the N-gram order based on your preference and computational resources.
* Run the autocompletion system and provide partial sentences as input. The system will suggest the next word or words to complete the sentence.
* Evaluate the performance of the language model using metrics such as perplexity or accuracy on a separate validation dataset.
